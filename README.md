# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.

Software Engineering is involved in the entire lifecyle of the software or project, from inception to development, testing and deployment, even uptil maintenace. while traditional programming is centred around writing codes to solve a specific problem.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
- Requirements: This is usually the first phase, it involves the gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements. 
- Design: In this phase, high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface is created.
- Implementation: This invoves the actual writing of codes and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing: Various tests are conducted on the software to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: The software is then released to users or customers.
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing and continous support, update and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

In the waterdall methodology, it involves the sequential approach with defined phases like: requirements, designs, implementation, flowing downwards. in this method, one phase has to be completed before the next phase begins and the phases has to be executed sequentially, while in the Agile methodology, it is an iterative and incremental approach that is focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change, one phase can start even before the preceding phase is completed.

Waterfall appraoch is ideal for short term projects while agile is preffered for long term projects.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. example: Git, Subversion.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

The sofware manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
some challanges are:
- Changing requirements
- Tight Deadlines
- Technical Debt

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

software maintenance involes continous and ongoing support, updates and enhancement provided to a software even after deployment.

maintenace activities includes, updates, bug fixes, enhancements etc
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Bias Amplication
Misinformation
Privacy concerns

Software engineers can ensure they adhere to ethical standards by adopting responsible software development practices essentail to address these concerns and ensure they promote fairness, transperency and accountability.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
